# Recipe to Markdown

This is a fork of the excellent [Pure Recipe](https://github.com/atiumcache/pure-recipe) CLI application which scrapes common recipe websites and formats them to Markdown files. The goal of this fork is to make the markdown output compatible with the [Nyum recipe manager](https://github.com/doersino/nyum) which converts Markdown files to a static website.
